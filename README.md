# SAR-Vegetation-Index
Estimating a SAR vegetation index similar to NDVI by neural networks and random forest algorithms. These approaches are assessed and validated by two sets of datasets: (RADARSAT2 and RapidEye) and (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2). Feature scaling, LASSO feature selection, and cross validation are used in the code.
